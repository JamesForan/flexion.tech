[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fa4d2e43-c49b-4340-86e2-c4b75682cac2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/flexion/deploys)

This is the code base for the flexion.tech website. Acting primarily as a blog site for now, this is a fork of hylia. 

## hylia 0.5.3 + following features
- Custom Logo
- Custom SVG Text heading, that changes with dark/light theme
- Subscribe component. Need to work on this to make it transferable to another site.
  - Links to Netlify Forms
  - minor updates to ServiceWorker.js to avoid [strange errors](https://community.netlify.com/t/form-submission-working-but-action-path-is-not-working/9902/7)
