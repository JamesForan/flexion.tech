New Beginnings
===========
Last year, I decided to start my own company. It has been something I have wanted to do for over 10 years. In that time I have been consulting and working as a solution architecture I have worked in with enterprise systems, primarily with Transport Management Systems (TMS) in Australia, and around the world. 

Now I find my self in need of a website. I am determined to do it myself, and learn a new set of skills along the way. I have a somewhat technical background. While not working as a developer, I have done some development in my time, and continue to enjoy the challenges that come with solving problems with technology. Last year I went down the Arduino rabbit hole, learning C++ and a little about electronics. 

# Tech Stack

About 4 weeks ago, i started on my journey of learing , HTML, and CSS really well, and doing a bit of javaScript if required.


I have spent much time doing tutorials on youTube, reading and researching on [w3schools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ "USE MDN instead!"), learning Adobe XD, and also Affinity Design. Because of course I don't want to just build a website, I want to design it, and make it beautiful.

As always, I really wanted to keep the site as simple as possible, while providing some core functionality. For now, I am staying away the popular JavaScript  frameworks  but I am very interested in building my website with a headless Content Management System, following the principals of [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/). 

# JAMStack

JAM stands for:
- JavaScript
- API
- Markup
 
JAMStack is of interest to me because it promises better performance, higher security, easier scaling and a better developer experience.

But when I looked further into it, I realised there is a whole other world of build tools that are needed for a modern static website. As is stands today, I don't want to delay this site any further. I want to get *something* out there, so I can start sharing my ideas.  But I am very reluctant to do down the WordPress path.

SO where to from here? JAMStack is pretty new, and as I said, many of the tools are quite intimidating for a newbie.  Likely I have been listening to [Shop Talk](https://shoptalk.com/) to try and get a better feel for the front end developer world. It has been a great resource for me, and I am starting to follow the conversations more each episode I listen too. One of the guests who really impressed me was [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw) who was talking about [11(ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/). So I did some research, and to be perfectly honest, I really had **no** idea where to start.

# Hylia

Thankfully, Andy  has already solved this problem with the [hylia Starter Kit](https://hylia.website/). It is super easy to get started with this template, and deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify are the company who has popularised static websites, by re-branding it as JAMStack. 

In addition, this also allows me to slowly learn more about headless CMS, build tools, HTML templates and javacript in the future.

That is how I got this site up and running within 24 hours. I have made a few minor updates to the template, but all in all, I have left it vanilla for now. I will now focus my efforts on getting great content out there, while continuing to progress the website design.

Its an exciting, and hopefully rewarding journey.
