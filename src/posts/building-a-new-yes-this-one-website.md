New Beginnings
===========
I recently went out on my own... Starting a business and trying to break from the norm.. For me, the norm has been consulting and solution architecture for many years. I have worked in with enterprise systems, primarily with Transport Management Systems (TMS) in Australia, and around the world. 

The challenges presented by implementing a [TMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_management_system "Transort Management System" ), as with any commercial system/often referred to as [COTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf "Commercial of the Shelf" ) is working within the constraints of the systems as well as working within the constraints of the organisation. But that is another story.. 

# Tech Stack

I have a somewhat technical background. While not working as a developer, I have done some development in my time, and continue to enjoy the challenges that come with solving problems with technology. Last year I went down the Arduino rabbit hole, learning C++ and a little about electronics. 

So no that I find myself in need of  a website, I though, why not do it myself.  That was about 4 weeks ago. I really wanted to learn the base technologies , HTML, and CSS really well. And of course I guess now I need to also learn a bit of JavaScript. 


I have spent much time doing tutorials on youTube, reading and researching on [w3schools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ "USE MDN instead!"), learning Adobe XD, and also Affinity Design. Because of course I don't want to just build a website, I want to design it, and make it beautiful.



As always, I want to KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) so I am staying away popular JavaScript  frameworks for now, but I am very interested in building my website with a headless Content Management System, following the principals of [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/). 

# JAMStack

JAM stands for:
- JavaScript
- API
- Markup
 
JAMStack is of interest to me because it promises better performace, higher security, easier scaling and a better developer experience.

But when I looked further into it, I realised there is a whole other world of build tools that are needed for a modern static website. As is stands today, I don't want to delay this site any further. I want to get *something* out there, so I can start sharing my ideas.  But I am very reluctant to do down the WordPress path.

SO where to from here? JAMStack is pretty new, and as I said, many of the tools are quite intimidating for a newbie.  Likely I have been listening to [Shop Talk](https://shoptalk.com/) to try and get a better feel for the front end developer world. It has been a great resource for me, and I am starting to follow the conversations more each episode I listen too. One of the guests who really impressed me was [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw) who was talking about [11(ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/). So i did some research, and to be perfectly honest, I really had **no** idea where to start.

# Hylia

Thankfully, Andy  has already solved this problem with the [hylia Starter Kit](https://hylia.website/). It is super easy to get started with this template, and deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify are the company who has popularised static websites, by rebranding it as JAMStack. 

In addition, this also allows me to slowly learn more about headless CMS, build tools, templating and javacript, in the future.

That is how I got this site up and running within 24 hours. I have made a few minor updates to the template, but all in all, I have left it vanilla for now. I will now focus my efforts on getting great content out there, while continuing to progress the website design.
