Consignments are a critical part of the transport industry. But over the years I have found that they have been the source of much confusion also, mainly on my part! In this post, I will detail my understanding of consignment, and some of the challenges that they can bring when doing a TMS.

# What is a Consignment
It might seem a simple question. Before I got into logistics, consignment to me meant selling goods "on Consignment", which basically meant that goods could be placed on sale in a store, without the store having to ever take ownership of the goods.

Ths same term also applies to the transport/shipping of goods via any mode of transport (road/rail/sea or air). The company responsible for the transport of the goods/freight does not have to purchase the goods in order to transport them. Similar to when goods are "on Consignment", they are acting as an intermediate party between the seller and the buyer.

## Consignor and consignee
The Consignor is the person sending the goods. They may also be called the shipper. If you buy an item from an online retailer, they the retailer is the consignor, or the shipper.  

That leaves us with the consignee. Int this case, you are the consignee. In most cases, you would be referred to as the receiver of the goods. Generally, this will only take place *after* you have paid for the goods. 

## Also Known As
A Consignment may not actually be called a consignment, for various reasons. It may often be referred to as a shipment, or job.

## Similar Too
A consignment is similar to a way-bill, or a house bill. While these are very similar to a consignment, they contain additional information including terms and conditions, and potentially route information also. A [bill of lading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_lading) is another similar term, however, this is a legal document confirming the receipt of goods by the carrier. International trade is a topic for another post though.
