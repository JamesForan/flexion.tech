If your household is anything like mine, you have seen a huge increase in the number of parcels that have been delivered to your house in the last month. With the entire world in lockdown, online shopping is one of the only "normal" things that we have left in our lives.

But how do all these items make it to your house? It appears to be quite different from the postal network that delivers our üêåmail. You cannot simply write an address on a box, and send it!

# The Post

Before we go on, have you ever wondered why it is call POST? Well I have, and there is a very interesting story on [Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail#History) Apparently the mail used to be nailed to a POST.. and eventually, the mail-bag was nailed to a post, and people used to go a "check the post".

Ok.. time back on track. What I actually wanted to talk about first is postal networks, the ones we used to use to send letters all around the globe, and that companies still use to send bills!

To send a letter, all you have to do is write an address, preferably neatly, and ideally, at least in Australia, you will write the postcode in the 4 small boxes provided. Next, you affix a stamp, which is how you pay for the service, and drop the letter in a post box.

From there, the mail goes to a local sort facility, starting its multi-leg journey to its recipient.

Automatic sortation systems can process over 50,000 letters an hour. For letters staying in country, sortation is done based on the postcode (aka zip code) . The systems that read the address have a pretty tough job. But, they do it quickly, and the actually print a postal barcode on the envelope or post card, which is then used to sort the mail automatically through the rest of the network.

Here is an postcard my son received recently. You can see the 4 state barcode faintly on the letter.

Another example of a 4 state barcode on a letter. These ones are printed on the letter by the sender, and are almost always BILLS!

For more info on these, read [this artcile from Australia Post](https://auspost.com.au/content/dam/auspost_corp/media/documents/barcoding-fact-sheet-oct14.pdf).

# Parcel

Today, postal networks are now capable of handling small, non-flat parcels too. But for this discussion, we are going to focus on parcels that cannot go via regular post.

So how do parcel networks vary from postal networks? The end result is much the same. The items being delivered ends up at your address! Simple. But, there are several things that make it more complex.

* Letters are generally flat, and are a fairly standard size. There is really only 1 place you can write an address too..
* a Parcel on the other hand, will have 6 sides and will vary in shape, dimensions and weight! You can stick a freight label anywhere you want too.
* Parcel networks have far fewer nodes. While most towns will have a post office, each major city may have only 1 parcel sortation facility per network.
* There is no single parcel network. While national postal companies offer this service, they are not alone. Even within single logistics organisations, multiple parcel networks may, and do exist.

But to send a parcel, you do not write the address on the box. you have to stick a label on the box, that contains a whole lot more information than just an address, or so it seems at least!

# Freight Label

So the Freight label is quite a strange one.... So why not just write the address on the box?

As we mentioned before, there is no single network, meaning there is also no single location where all parcels addressed to you go, before the last leg of the journey. Each parcel carrier will have their own set of hubs or nodes. Once the parcel gets

Also, each network has their own sortation system. Many of these are manual, or semi-manual, but there are many sortation facilities that automatically sort parcels too. It is more complicated that mail not just due 6 sides, but also the way logistics companies charge for these services.

# Check Weight Cube (CWC)

Unlike posting a letter, which has a fixed cost, and is often pre-paid, logistics companies need to know then weight, and dimensions of each parcel, as parcels are paid for based on Dimensions, and Weight.

## Scanning a Freight Label

You can do this at home, with your smart phone! That QR code, may contain

So, next time you get something delivered, check out the freight label in a little more detail. And if you receive a letter, or post card, look out for the orange barcode, and see if you can work out what it says!
