## Blue Yonder

Last week there was a major announcement that JDA has rebranded to [Blue Yonder](https://blueyonder.com/).

In 2018, JDA purchased BlueYonder at that time was a company that utilised AI and ML algorithms to help organisations make better decisions, resulting in a more efficient supply chain.

We are yet to see how this technology will be utilised to enhance JDA TMS, however, with the re-branding of JDA to Blue Yonder, we can be assured that there will be some interesting developments in the years to come.

## Digitisation

For many businesses, realising the benefits of AI technology is also years off. But it will be critical for companies to ensure they have the correct foundations in place, to take advantage of AI and ML in the years to come.

Digitisation is a word so first, I am going to define exactly what it means in this context:

 Digitisation means converting information into a format that can be processed by a computer.

Digitisation takes place in steps. Lets take freight tracking as a example, and look through the various stages of digitisation.

1. Barcodes are added to manual consignments, to allow for scanning within freight facilities.
2. Drivers are provided with [MDT's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_data_terminal 'Mobile Data Terminal') to enable consignment scanning delivery points, and genaration of electronic [POD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_delivery).
3. Consignments labels are generated for each item at the despatch location , removing the need for manual data entry for billing purposes, and allowing for partial POD's, and item level freight tracking.

## Artificial Intelligence Example

Lets look at an example organisation who is wanting to take the advantage of AI to enable forecasting for the number of drivers required to execute deliveries in the afternoon. The inputs into the AI algorithm will be:

 - Historical consignment data
 - Consignment data (destination info)
 - Consignment item details, including current location
 - customer forecasts
 - environmental forecasts
 	- weather
 	- traffic

- Driver capabilities - vehicle capacity

## Potential Issues

| Issue | Description | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manual procedures | Even though the organisation has digitised much of its operations, it still has long standing customers who are not able to provide consignment data electronically in time for the AI algorithms to run, and staffing decisions to be made | Allow for this "unknown" quantity in the algorithm, and utilise historical data to forecast consignment data |
| External dependencies | The algorithms accuracy is now dependent on the availability of information from many sources. Any delay in receiving information will effect the accuracy of the forecast. | Build in fall-back options for every data source and enable user input for external figures |
| Missing parameters | If the algorithm does not include critical parameters that have an impact on the number of drivers needed, the accuracy of the system will not be trusted by operational personnel, and the system will not be used |AI algorithms must be designed **with** operational people. This is a huge change management challenge, as these systems are seen as a threat. People will hold onto critical information if they are not part of the solution.
| Scale |For potential benefits to turn into real benefits, appropriate scale must exist to ensure that the costs of implementation are lower than the savings to be realised by the organisation.| Engage with experts with a proven track record in the logistics industry, as well as your geography.|
| Unnecessary Complexity | Complexity come in many forms. If you are utilising multiple internal systems to capture consignments for example, or customer forecasts are in different formats, this added complexity will mean data scientists will first have to interpret and standardise data before the AI algorithms can run. | Remove complexity where possible |

## Removing Unnecessary Complexity
Organisations who are have removed as much complexity as possible will be in a far better position to take advantage of the latest AI technology, faster and cheaper. They will also be able to evaluate the benefits of technology faster, meaning they can fail faster too. 
If an organisation must spend $X millions of dollars getting data standardised before they can run a [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept "Proof of Concept") or pilot site, they will always be playing catchup. 

### Don't expose operations to greater complexity
The example we are looking at relies heavily multiple external factors. In a real world example these would likely increase, to also include sub-contractor availability, warehouse and sort facility integration and would continue to increase before it was able to produce valuable input to operations. If you are going to be impacting operations, ensure AI is complimentary to existing processes, and not *replacing* them. 

## Start with Value added Services
Lets go back to our original example of freight tracking. One of the areas the logistics industry struggles with across the board is tracking freight through depots and cross docks where predominantly manual processes exist. Organisations could serve customers better if they had a vision based system which could track freight in real time from the moment it is unloaded from a truck, to when it leaves the facility. Such systems could provide valuable input to operations and customers, and the solutions could grow in complexity over time. 

### Take aways
- AI is extremely reliant on a healthy digital diet. Make sure you are feeding it well.
- Remove unnecessary complexity where possible before embarking on bespoke AI solutions.
- Utilise AI to add value without impacting on operations.
